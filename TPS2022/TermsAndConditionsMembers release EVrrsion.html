<li><b> Welcome Citizen, We are so stoked to have you!</b></li><br>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unicorn Dick: Investigations is more than just a generative NFT collection, but behind this awesome NFT set is a well developed world being produced into a full fledged animated series, powered by Polygon and NFT collectors like you!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We appreciate your interest in joining our community and minting your first “Citizen of Unicornitopia!” We have been hard at work over the last 3 years together as a team dedicating our free time as sweat-equity in order to bring you our show and our NFTs, all of which will grow alongside one another!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, we must ensure the security of our team in the form of these terms and conditions. Our legal council has broadened our understanding of the emerging technology, and we want to ensure not only our safety, but safety and peace of mind for our NFT holders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to remain open and transparent with our fans, offering insight into the challenges and trials faced by the NFT space, and alleviate any concerns when putting your time and money into our NFTs. Feel free to hop on our discord and ask any questions or voice any concerns! We are happy to discuss and make this a safe haven for all!</span></p>
<ol start="2"><br>
<li><b> What Belongs to Us</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unicorn Dick: Investigations (UD), and all of its subsequent characters, imagery, branding, and art are all owned and operated by Twitch Pixel Studios Inc. Founded in 2017 . All rights and ownership not specifically outlined as granted to the users &amp; owners of our NFTs, are reserved by Twitch Pixel Studios Inc. This includes but are not limited to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intellectual property rights surrounding both Twitch Pixel Studios and Unicorn Dick: Investigations’s brand, names, logos, trademarks, website, smart contract code, generative traits, future community wallets, expanded universe shorts, our main series episodes, concept art, development assets, and animations, are all the sole property of Twitch Pixel Studios inc.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br><br></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to our IP ownership, the Name “Twitch Pixel Studios” and “Unicorn Dick: Investigations” and all logos and branding assets are reserved exclusively to be used for future promotional and merchandising purposes.</span></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3"><br>
<li><b> Full ownership of your Citizen</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Initial product launch of UD is a collection of 8000 individual ERC-721 tokens (“Citizens” or “NFTs”) with generative traits and artwork to be hosted on IPFS. By connecting your crypto wallet and minting a “Citizen” with our smart contract you become the full and complete owner of your NFT collectible..</span></p>
<ol start="4"><br>
<li><b> Exclusive Commercial Rights Ownership</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ownership of a UD NFTs grants you full commercial rights to use your owned NFTs in perpetuity, for as long as the NFTs remain under your ownership. Other commercial projects may be assigned some of these rights, but in the event of future transfer of NFT ownership, the NFT will remain subject to the rights that you or subsequent owners may assign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ownership means you can use your NFT on products, clothing and merchandise, include them in video projects and games, and overall do whatever you like with them provided you retain ownership.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Name Twitch Pixel Studios (TPS) and Unicorn Dick: Investigations (UD) may not be used on any commercial project without explicit permission from the original IP Holder (Twitch Pixel Studios). You also agree not to use your Citizen NFT in any project or derivative work that involves hate speech, racism, pornography, or any other illegal content.</span></p>
<ol start="5"><br>
<li><b> Derivative Works are allowed</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our world is your world, and we want you to have the flexibility to create new use cases for your NFTs. You are assigned the rights to create derivative works of your “Citizen” NFT, as long as you own the NFT at the time of creation. You may also assign the rights to other creatives , artists, or third parties as long as you continue to own your NFT at the time you grant these permissions.</span></p>
<ol start="6"><br>
<li><b> Many Unrestricted Third Party Uses</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our intention with our terms is not to limit you or any third parties from:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(i) ownership and operations of any marketplace for NFTs which permits the sale or use of our Citizens, provided the marketplace verifies ownership cryptographically, ensuring only the owner may display and/or use their Citizen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ii) ownership and operations of any third party websites which allows for the involvement or inclusion of the Citizens in general, provided the website owner verifies ownership cryptographically, ensuring only the owner may display and/or use their Citizen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition these Terms of Service are not meant to restrict any third party websites and/or platforms ability to create tools and track the data of the Citizens for their traits and sales information.</span></p>
<ol start="7"><br>
<li><b> Limitations of Liability for Gas, Failed Transactions, Smart Contract Bugs</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have diligently developed our smart contract to be error free in order to create a smooth launch when our NFT collections drop. However due to the nature of the project things can sometimes fail. You agree to hold Twitch Pixel Studios Inc. (The Company) harmless for any losses you may incur when minting your Citizen NFTs. Potential Losses include excessive fee’s and gas fees due to a website or smart contract error, gas fee’s from failed transactions, and any loss of NFTs from errors arising from the smart contract or website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be noted however that since we are using the Polygon (MATIC) Block chain gas wars, and gas fees should be negligible.</span></p>
<ol start="8"><br>
<li><b> No Guarantees or Future Promises</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitch Pixel Studios strives to continuously grow our projects and community. Following our road map outlining our milestones for both our NFTs and Animated Series production, we may continuously update or alter our schedule.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we are fully committed to meeting and exceeding these milestones, the nature of our project means we cannot guarantee the project will sell out nor can we guarantee future developments. You agree that your Citizen from our initial drop is all you are guaranteed to receive with your purchase. Any future community growth, drops, or other benefits are ancillary to your initial purchase, and not to be considered as a part of your initial purchase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree that there is no reliance on future commitments by Twitch Pixel Studios when using our website, campaign page, discord, or participating in our NFT launch.</span></p>
<ol start="9"><br>
<li><b> Citizens NFTs Are NOT Intended as Investments</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our “Citizens of Unicornitopia” NFTs are meant as a fun way to collect and support our cool animated series. These NFTs are not an investment vehicle. We make no claims, promises or guarantees that these NFTs will be worth anything or grow beyond your initial purchase. You accept that there is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">no inherent monetary value</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in these NFTs and should be considered entirely a collectible digital item!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purchasing these items via Flair.Finance and their payment options, or any secondary markets, is a means of crowdfunding to support our indie studio and the development of our content.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol start="10"><br>
<li><b> Taxes</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are fully responsible for any tax liability that may incur from Minting, holding, or re-selling your NFTs.</span></p>

<li><b> Class Action Waiver</b></li>

Treat each other's ideas with a “yes, and…” mentality to help expand ideas and not stifle them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This being said we also want to try and keep this a space for everyone to feel comfortable, and so there are some ground rules.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br><br></span></p>
