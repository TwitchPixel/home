Mors brought death, not as some sorrow filled event, but as a natural consequence to life, bringing meaning to existence.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Each of the Grand Unicorns embodied a part of what allows all universes to exist in order of creation, Time, Life and subsequently Death.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Elements of Creation</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Then came the Elemental Unicorns. Both Aqua and Aer were born into existence to balance Vita, and Terra and Ignis to balance Mors.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">They each wandered through the vastness of existence aimlessly at first trying to understand who, and what they were, eventually they began to one by one find each other within the newly forming multiverse, once gathered they became &quot;The First Great Herd&quot;.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">They found each other as they each were drawn back to the heart-shaped planet, pulled unknowingly toward the source of their creation, and the power they shared, the power of imagination.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Welcome to Unicornitopia</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The Hearts formed a great mass of matter filled with twisting cave-like arteries that would protect them, a heart-shaped box keeping safe their child within. It was on this massive protective shell on which the world of Unicornitopia itself would one day be created.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The Unicorns first ran as a herd across the universe as it grew, and with them came the beginning of life. One by one, as each returned home to join their family, each became a line of color in the now great Rainbow rings that circle the world.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">It is said the grand unicorns learned to manipulate and shape the young dragon&#39;s daughter&#39;s imagination, and from it, the first denizens of Unicornitopia!</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.pabe164icllv"><span class="c7">Tempus</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The First Unicorn</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The Grand Unicorn Tempus, the first of his kind; and very well the most important being in the universe, next to the great Dragons and their child Imaginatia.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Tempus&#39;s creation and first steps into the multiverse began the churn of time itself. Moment by moment, the grand unicorn brought the forward march of time to the universe, giving the young dragon-ling the time to let life grow and evolve all on its own.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Soothing the Child</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">This freed Imaginatia from the responsibility for her genocide, the mass collapse of life in her early moments, when her mind was overcome and life would spawn and die as quickly as an anxious breath from her chest.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Legend</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Tempus was a grey coated unicorn with a black speckled grey mane and tail. His hooves were made of brass like the clockwork of a pocket watch, and with each step he took the faint sound of a clocktower bell to ring out. His horn, too, was made of brass, and its muted shine revealed timeless cracks, and ageless scars that were chipped from its rough surface.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">One eye was staggeringly white with orange edges bleeding in like the sun, and his other eye was black as night and speckled with the glimmer of blue and purple stars. His snout was scruffy like his coat, his chin anchored a short unmanicured beard which faded into an ever-flowing edge of sand like grains dropped from an hour glass.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">His defining spot on his neck mimicked the shape of an hourglass, peeking out from under his tattered old robes, He carried himself with strength, though his appearance would make one think otherwise, he was a strong and healthy unicorn and would be for eternity.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The March Forward Begins</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">At first, Tempus wandered the known multiverse, each new realm he entered would begin its slow tick forward with time. He brought them life through time, but with life and time, ultimately comes death.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">From his slow march across existence, life formed, all with the creation of the second of the Grand unicorns, Vita. Given the tie to exist, given the means to form and evolve, life was inevitable, and Tempus would bring about the first era of the multiverse known only as &ldquo;Youth&rdquo;</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.6c9d5s676phc"><span class="c7">Vita</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Time for Life</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">When time began its first steps forward with the creation of Tempus, soon life was to follow. Vita, the bearer of life, would become the second grand unicorn to enter existence into the Imaginated multiverse.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Like the winds on the ocean, she swept across the vastness of eternity, in her wake life would form. The simple to the complex her magic would spark the stirrings of early life and the universe would be all the more beautiful for it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Tree&#39;s and plant&#39;s flowered across the universe as nature took root as the first life to form, and with its abundance, in its infinite variation, evolution began to take hold and the multiverse began to grow on its own.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">A Call Home</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Through the cosmos of imagination she roamed, everything she touched brimming with life constantly on the move, yet drawn inexplicably somewhere, back to her roots, back to where it all began, back to the Heart Shaped Planet.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">After eons traveling across dimensions seeding life, Vita found herself home, at least that is how it felt to her, This barren heart shaped world, formed ages before she took her first steps and here she was, connected to it, to her very core.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">She felt Imaginatia, and for the first time knew of her creation, understood her power, and knew now she must wait. For centuries she would wait, the life and the heart-shaped world flourished around her as she rested, nearly consuming her, she almost lost herself in its depth and beauty.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">And Along Came Death</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Then it happened, the rot, the decay, it ate at her forest of verdant green and dampened the rich colors of their bloom. It turned to ash, through fire and dust, consumed by sandstorms and raging earthquakes, and the world was thrown into chaos.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">But she did not fret, no tear for the life that was swept away in the desolation, for she knew this was inevitable, this is what she waited for, this was who she was waiting for, death itself, Mors.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Her role in existence was to bring life to the multiverse, in her steps, life followed and flourished, all the while, far behind her, another unicorn was born, created of necessity, the inevitable outcome when life meets time, the only end&hellip; death.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.okyay3pr8e49"><span class="c7">Mors</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Path of Death:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Mors&#39; existence started centuries after Vita as the first truly conscious and self-aware beings began to question their existence and what comes after. He followed Vita&#39;s path through the multiverse, seeding the first life. With each step forward, he brought ruin and decay to the flourishing trail of life.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">However, Mors&#39; fate was not to be alone forever. Driven by the same desire as Vita to seek out the Heart Shaped World, find the source of his creation, and join Vita and Tempus in creating something new and magical.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">His journey was filled with trials and hardships, meeting life throughout the budding multiverse only when it was time for them to die. Through him, their essence passed back to imagination, and with each death, Mors became more understanding, more capable of compassion.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Mors became wise, gaining control over the chaos from which he was born. The hardships he faced prevented him from becoming like his grandfather, the great dragon Chao.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Meaning of Death:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Mors has many names, but to the common tongue, Death rings true as any other. Initially a burden, he turned it into a calling. He found a truth that he didn&#39;t expect, that helping others with their grief can overcome our own grief. This revelation changed him to the core, and through it, he changed perceptions of death in many cultures across the multiverse.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">His dedication to his role became more than just his dismal fate, but an opportunity to bring solace.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Return Home:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Mors&#39; journey was far different from Vita&#39;s creation of life, bringing a different perspective on the multiverse when he finally arrived back to the heart-shaped world to meet his counterpart. He knew they were bound for eternity, so he was cautious on his approach. However, his suspicions were expelled when he first laid eyes on her.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">She had found understanding of their shared fate and had given herself over to it. Any fear she may have had had faded long before this inevitable moment had arrived.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Truth of Death:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Together, the final connection between Vita and Mors was formed, forever the first and last link in the chain of life. She would stand as a symbol of all that is new, all that will come, and the life that will evolve from it. He represented not the end of life, but the value of life, for without him, the preciousness of life was fleeting.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Elements of Life &amp; Death:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The planet settled, scarred from their immense connection. They now stood on the land mass they had ripped from the surface, floating in an ethereal trance above the crater it left behind on the planet&#39;s surface.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The world was devoid of light, and even the stars struggled to shine through the shadowed sky. Mors felt it first, a warm wave brushed by him. Then he saw sparks flicker and dissipate, soon erupting into a flame that rolled in and around itself until folding and exploding into a portal of fire.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Through it stepped the first of the Elemental Unicorns born of Mors, Ignis. Ignis&#39;s light revealed the other Elementals, including Aqua, Aer, and the others born of Mors. Terra erupted from a pile of rocks at their feet.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.mu2r5jv6str9"><span class="c7">The Elemental Unicorns</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Aqua</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Aqua is the unicorn of water, born of life herself and daughter of Vita. She is bound to existence and revered as a bringer of renewal and sustenance. Aqua is the calming voice of Ordo in Vitas personality, providing her with wisdom and forethought.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Like her crustacean friends, Aqua was a hermit who hid away in the oceans, creating her own idea of life within the warm waters of the heart-shaped world. She did not see the other elementals until the great desolation after centuries.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Aer</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Aer is the unicorn of air, known for bringing about the winds of change and the essence of Chao seen in Vitas personality. The Chaos of Nature and life comes from him, and without it, Vitas life would be stagnant and identical, with no variation or uniqueness.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Aers influence on life imbues all forms with a lust for exploration, to reach the next peak, sail the next ocean, and a constant thirst for the winds of change. His own yearning for adventure influences life, and this same wanderlust attracts him to Ignis, whose fiery passion and free spirit are intoxicating.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Terra</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Terra is matter itself incarnate, earth and stone. The natural world fed her creation and thoughts Mors power, and she was born strong-willed but quiet, like a stone. Terra prefers her relationship with the flora and fauna that she is from, much like Aqua prefers her oceans and the life within.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Her influence on life is immeasurable, directly spawning life in the form of what has become their own species known as &quot;The Naturals.&quot; Without the bastion of diversity found in the forests and jungles of the multiverse, life would not have the means to take root.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Ignis</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Ignis is the closest to Chao&#39;s essence, being a fire elemental with a hot temper and passionate, fiery personality. Born of the fires of creation, Ignis gives balance to Chao&#39;s influence.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Ignis&#39;s eye is drawn to adventure and wanderlust, which first attracted Aer to him. The two wander the world, spreading fire and wind. However, air and fire are a dangerous combination, feeding each other and hurting each other in the process.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Desolation of Aer and Fire</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Aer and Ignis became entwined in a dangerous and passionate love, both feeding one another and causing great storms that swept across the land. Volcanoes erupted and rose from the oceans, and the world was forever changed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The world was ravaged by their love in its early state. The landscape became scarred and ragged, with mountains rippling through the terrain, floods carving out valleys and forming lakes, and intense ecological events shaping the planet&#39;s surface and spreading the seeds for life across it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">But it had to end. The damage done on the ocean floor had caused a rift between Aer and Aqua, and the irreparable terraforming of the landscape had nearly killed Terra, leaving her battered and weak.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Aqua and Terra confronted the two, showing them what they had wrought, what their unbridled love had done to this once calm world. For days, they showed them the scarred canyons, the deep gouging lakes, and the crushing mountains. Decades passed before they would settle, during which time the rift between the Elementals grew. Each battled nature to their last breath, giving everything of themselves to calm the world and let life begin again.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Elements Fade</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Aqua was the first to go, giving her molecules to rain down and soothe the fires of Ignis that raged. Her sacrifice is believed to have started the first rainbow rains, a rainfall that happens once a year where the droplets come down tinted all colors of the rainbow. Her essence spread through all the oceans of the world, and the first elementals known as the Primals emerged from the waters. They were water incarnate, given consciousness and life.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Second to go was Ignis. His fires quenched by Aqua, he had weakened, and he knew he would have to give himself to the eternal fire to ensure all fires could be controlled and kept from spreading at their own will. This is the legend of how life here tamed the flame. Stories are still told around the fire of Ignis, who keeps the flames at bay, preventing them from reaching out and burning you with their tendrils. With his sacrifice came the first sentient fire Primals.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">With Ignis gone, the next to leave was Aer. With his love gone, he had gone into a rage. A massive windstorm ravaged every corner of the planet in his grief, but he had spread himself too thin and dissipated into the winds. Now, it is said that the gusts of wind are merely Aer trying to reform himself. Through Aer&#39;s essence, the first air Primals gained sentience.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The last elemental unicorn was Terra, who roams alone across the planet, caretaking the forest and all the life that began to retake the world after the Cataclysm Ignis and Aer had brought.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Eventually, Terra would find rest. Her final resting place isn&#39;t known, but speculation has her wandering into the forest, where she found herself in a beautiful meadow with a winding stream. The soothing trickle of Aqua from the stream calmed her as she lay to rest. A gust of wind wrapped her in the tall grass like a blanket laid over her by Aer, and with the warmth of Ignis&#39;s sunset, she felt at peace with her elemental brethren.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">With a final breath, she gave herself to the forest. The fungal network below her drew in her essence, and the world network of plants gained sentience. With that, the first of the Naturals were born alongside their caretakers, the first earth Primals.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.89jxnoz62169"><span class="c7">Magic &amp; Science</span></h2><h2 class="c6" id="h.o4h7ownf85v2"><span class="c7">Unicornitopia</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The heart-shaped planet that protects the imagination of existence and spawned the first life of the multiverse has become known as Unicornitopia. It is the first bastion of life, the home of the First Herd, and the playground for a child&#39;s imagination that has the power to create life.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">However, the planet and its inhabitants have become worse for wear, their society in turmoil, and the future uncertain. Few see this as a utopia, and many feel that the end may be closer than they realize.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.2jjossbtjyyj"><span class="c7">The Rainbow Convergence</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3">What Begins Must End.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Vita and Mors found each other on their journey back to the source that created them, back to Imaginatia, back to the Heart Shaped Planet.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Their inevitable convergence ravaged the heart-shaped world until the two finally met face to face. The energy between them, the power that surged, fractured the planet below them. With a single touch, life and death became forever linked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Birth of the Elements</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The blast between them decimated the earth around, tearing a city-sized chunk of the planet with them. The chunk now held mystically steadfast and sturdy, floating above the now massive crater below. Then, a sudden blinding flash of light ended in an echoing silence.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The two found themselves awakening in the darkness. Near Mors, a sudden spark of light, and another, flickered and danced about until rolling over into itself and igniting in a golden red flame. From the flame stepped out Ignis, the elemental Unicorn, lighting their surroundings to reveal more movement in the dark. From a pile of rock emerged Terra, the elemental Unicorn of Earth, and next to Vita stepped out Aqua from a settled puddle. With a gust of sand and wind, the Unicorn Aers emerged.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Ascension</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Through life and death, both tempered by time, the elemental forces of the multiverse were born. And now, the moment had come for them to ascend. In a flash of splendorous light, Vita and Mors were gone.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The planet fell dark for a moment, unveiling the majesty of the stars above and outlining the galactic stage in light and color, until a new light began to shine. It started as an ominous bright red at first, followed by a rich and bright blue hue that cooled the shifting tones of the sky. From there, all manner of colors overtook the sky above the floating island, as an organized array of rainbow colors formed dual ribbons of light around the circumference of the planet.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The colors settled and mixed as they beamed down towards the ground, filling the world with a pure white light, lighting the way to the future for the elemental unicorns to forge.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">New Life Eternal</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Now caretakers of this newborn world and under the watchful eye above, the first elemental unicorns roamed the planet&#39;s surface. They knew that above them were the two great rainbow rings, twisting around the planet like bands of infinity, nurturing them and helping this world to flourish.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Now fallen to myth and legend, it is held by many that the grand herd watches down over Unicornitopia in disdain, forsaking them for the state of their world. As the city falls ever deeper into chaos and squalor, the rings begin to fade, and some wonder if this could mark the end&hellip;</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.lbfl39fmj9io"><span class="c7">The Heart Shaped Planet</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Beating Heart of the Multiverse</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">This oddity of a planet is made from the flesh and bone of the Great Dragons Ordo and Chao, and serves as a protective shell around the mystical Hearts that safeguard the creator of all the Imaginated multiverse, the dragon daughter Imaginatia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">It is believed that as the Great Herd found its way home, they merged with Imaginatia (see The First Herd) and became the great Rainbow Rings that surround the planet. Now, as they guide the maturing fledgling, they help her to form new life and new universes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">That Born of an Innocent Mind</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">In their likeness came the elemental Unicorns, and soon the world around them would be filled with life. The child&#39;s mind created the Candies to bring about sweetness and comfort to this growing world. Then the Mythicals emerged, and all manner of new and strange creatures filled the first great realm from the young dragon&#39;s mind&#39;s eye.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">All manner of childish ideas, without rules or physics to enforce their laws of existence. Whatever the childlike imagination could conjure became real, conscious, and began to evolve on their own on the surface of this heart-shaped world.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Forgotten with Age</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">It has been speculated that billions of years have passed since the imagined universe formed and much has happened: realms created and destroyed, life born and evolved. As the eternal dragon matures, so do her creations; new worlds in other universes, such as our own, are filled with the imaginings of a slowly maturing dragon.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Unicornitopia, the city founded on the surface of this heart-shaped world, has become a metropolis, home to millions of fantastical creatures. Each creature contains within it the potential for order or chaos, and all are full of imagination!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Over time, the young dragon&#39;s mind wandered from this heart-shaped world, and soon it became forgotten along with countless more universes as she created countless more.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.rpk75eo1pal"><span class="c7">The Industrialization of Magic</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Bright Future</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">For some time, the Primals had grown arrogant, fancying themselves gods. They sought more power, more influence, and more adoration, and so they began work on their Magnum Opus. They would harness magic&#39;s true essence, distilled into a crystal that would power their world for eternity.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The thing is, it worked, at least for a time. For decades, this new evolution revolutionized their society. Their magic inventions were adapted into crystal-powered technologies that made their way into every home and every pocket. Everyone was connected to the Light, every device fed from it, and everyone had a device. Connection to knowledge and power was at their fingertips, magics that would otherwise be inaccessible were made available for any and all who would pay for it, and pay for it they did.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Like the fables of Atlantis and the fall of Rome, their civilization grew quickly, and their hubris matched it. Over a century later, Rainbowopolis in its current form was a new and shiny statement to the universe. It was a massive connected city full of prosperity, a place created to service and support all, governed by the Council of 9. Their future was so bright that it blinded them to the encroaching Darkness.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Fracturing the Light with Darkness</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">It was only a whisper that started the fall, the faint calling of a dark destiny that dipped into the mind of the noble and valiant Unicorn Knight, Lance-a-clop, who protected the city and the Council of 9 who stewarded this near-Utopia. This once-valiant protector would betray the 9 in an attempted coup as the darkness took hold of him. No one to this day knows why or how he became overtaken, but the aftermath of his ambition was nothing short of desolation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Lance-a-clop masqueraded his way through the city, capturing one by one each of the Council of Nine, each within a marble, trapping them and their power within. All but one council member remained elusive, but it was too late. He had gathered enough power. Pushing toward the highly protected Crystal Shard, from which all shards were grown, Lance-a-clop forced his darkness to warp the crystal, shaping it to his will, and he began to absorb all its power.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">In this moment, when the world fell dark, and the magic began to fade, a single point of light cut through. The Crystal cracked, fracturing across its surface and surging with light. With a cracking flash and a resounding echo, the crystal had cleansed the darkness and shattered to pieces like a pile of embers in the Crystal Chamber.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Birth of the Rainbow Orb</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The blast had torn through reality, shattering dimensions and converging them all into a single point before settling into a swirling orb of color and smoke, an anomaly leading to... everywhere. The Rainbow Orb.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">In the end, the now corrupted knight was defeated, and for a time, the world began to rebuild in his wake. But the seed of darkness had been planted, creeping into the very magics they relied upon and tainting all who wielded it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The Rainbow Orb brought with it more problems than wonders, as through it came a slew of strange creatures, new life, and worse, garbage, all the lost and forgotten items from around the verse, some even coming to life themselves based on the personifications they were given in their previous dimension.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">This new life and all this refuse would become a huge problem over the decades, increasing the population and smothering the city in garbage. Contending with a crumbling city, all these new citizens, and a never-ending spew of junk, their world collapsed around them, leaving an open wound.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Years later, the darkness returned, having learned from its previous mistakes and infecting another wayward soul. This time it bided its time, preparing for its return. It waited until the city was at its worst, and then took control.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.1oqb87b6vla2"><span class="c7">Rainbowopolis</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Paradise Lost:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The shining city that once floated above the crater of The Hollow below, serving as a bastion for hope, kindness, and understanding, is now a fractured island above its garbage-filled crater. Bridges like tendrils span the gap to the mainland below, connecting it to those who live in squalor, where the downtrodden attempt to make their lives the best they can in the run-down city of Mythagin that lines the crater&#39;s edge.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Rainbowopolis was once a galactic lighthouse, a safe haven port, a utopian society that spanned the stars and built a society for all its strange forms of life to thrive. But as the beat of the universe throbs to the dragons&#39; hearts, order and chaos would always ebb and swell. Their utopia was upended, the dark times consumed it, and Rainbowopolis fell to ruin.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Great Social Divide:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The glitz and glam of candy-coated high rises and sidewalks made of solid sugar display the opulence and classist mindset of the rich and corrupt who control the city and its inhabitants. The only way to live here is either through servitude or eternal debt, and neither come with freedom. The sugar barons have taken control of the city&#39;s supply of their most valuable resource, and now the flow of sugar to the masses has been restricted and carefully controlled.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">A far cry from the days of the Council of 9, the city is now under the ruthless control of these sugar barons and their leader, the mysterious benefactor who seems to control them from the shadows.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Galactic Stage:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Off-world trade and export thrive at the top of the once magnificent towers that lit up the city&#39;s skyline. However, they now serve as a hotbed for sanctioned criminals to exploit the vulnerable, all to keep the Barons in control for some larger nefarious plan.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Crater in Society:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The city floats above the massive crater of the Hollow below. The city&#39;s refuse is dumped into the massive caverns below, where only the most unfortunate try to eke out an existence on the scraps of the city above.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Along with the refuse are the forgotten, strange inanimate objects from around the multiverse that have been lost or forgotten, which make their way here through the Rainbow Orb, a portal at the heart of the city above. This portal is controlled by the Sugar Barons.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Sometimes these objects fall through and gain sentience, but no one knows why, and few dare to speculate. Most of these sentient artifacts from other worlds are taken into forced labor, and the few that slip by find themselves on the fringes of society in Hollow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The city itself is mostly inaccessible even from the surface in Mythagin. Access is tightly controlled, with exceptions for the labor force. Much of the upper city is entirely inaccessible to the average middle-class citizen, unless they have the proper connections, of course.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">A Deeply Layered City</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The city is built on a foundation of prior generational cities, with each new layer built on top of the last, creating a literal and metaphorical hierarchy. The lower sections are less exposed to the light above, and as a result, have become a hotbed for the black market for all the luxuries of the city above.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">These layers have created a dark side to the city known as the Underside. This hidden world of strays and criminals includes lost and lawless city sectors and industrial parks. It serves as a haven for the rebellious element trying to take back the city for the people, and is tightly controlled by them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The Underside is a labyrinth of old cities, transitways, and industrial complexes that power and provide for the city above. It is nearly impossible to track the rebels that know this underside so very well.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">A tedious cold war between the Sugar Barons who control the city and the rebellious smugglers below keeps the elite on their toes. The rebels tend to take pot shots and play it safe, knowing that an all-out offensive would mean their end, as they have little resources and dwindling support.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.7zyo8u4px0xv"><span class="c7">Mythagin</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Welcome to Mythagin:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The outer city is comprised of the dregs of society crammed into public housing, forced into poverty, and faced with a slowly degrading quality of life, a life withheld from them by greed and corruption.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The citizens of this not-so-fair city are tough; most have struggled all their lives and will never know comfort and stability like the elite who flaunt their riches in the big city.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">A City of Neglect:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Mythagin is a city of neglect, separate from the shining towers of Rainbowopolis. It is a much more run-down, under-maintained city that spans the entire circumference of the crater&#39;s edge, which Rainbowopolis mystically floats above.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Bridges do connect the city to Mythagin, but they are tightly monitored and controlled by the city&#39;s elite, making access near impossible without the right connections or forfeiture of your rights.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">A Sorted Past:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Mythagin has a colorful history. Even in the days of the Council of 9, where things were considered a near-utopian society, Mythagin served as a place for those not rich enough or lucky enough to find themselves fully enlightened within the city&rsquo;s walls.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">By no means were they destitute like many of the citizens today, but there was still an evident level of inequality among the residents of the city and those in Mythagin. It was actually Mythagin that first fell from grace when the Council of 9 mysteriously disappeared and the Sugar Barons took over.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Playing on Mythagin&#39;s dissatisfaction with the city&#39;s exclusion of them, the Sugar Barons and their master sowed a divide in their already frustrated community, tearing down their entirely satisfactory lives.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Civil Unrest:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The people of Mythagin threatened the city with blockades, employee walkouts, and service shutdowns all across the city. In response, the city was locked down, but not before the Sugar Barons could relocate their operations within the city walls.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">With the mounting divide and pressure for the Council of 9 to submit, their decisions were corrupted by the mastermind who vied for control over them all, although their intentions were true.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The Council distracted, the Sugar Barons unleashed their army of dissidents and criminals and force-fed the public with disinformation throughout the city to conceal their ultimate plan.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">A City Changed:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Before they could react, it was over. From within their own ranks, the Dark Unicorn Knight Lanceclop revealed himself, dismantling the council. But in his moment of triumph, this Dark Unicorn Knight was thwarted by an unlikely hero and he was destroyed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">But the damage had been done, and his corruption had saturated the city. This corruption bided its time, found a new host, only to return more cunning than ever. Now from the shadows, this corrupted being controls everything. The more power they gain, the more Mythagin falls to ruin, and with it, the Rainbow rings that light their sky fade a shade darker each day.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.4i9qw0veu1t3"><span class="c7">The Hollow</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3">A Knife in the Planet:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The cavernous hall is made of natural uncanny stone pillars which dip themselves into the flowing rivers of sugar that wind their way through the arteries of the heart-shaped world. The pillars are grand in scale and they tower like mountains towards the surface where the crater trickles light past the shining city floating above. The underside of the landmass held motionless in the sky juts down into the caverns below, a hollow spike of twisted rock like a knife plunged into the heart of the planet.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Sky is Falling:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The daily refuse rain falls from the cavernous hole that is naturally carved from the center of the floating landmass. The trash rains down over the docks as the downtrodden citizens of Fort Trash scramble to their trash catchers and begin to pull in the day&#39;s haul. Leftovers and garbage from the city above, and a few new forgotten citizens to fill their ranks. Another day, another rain, thundering down into the sugar flows below, poisoning the planet to the core.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">A Lost Connection:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The Hollow used to represent a near spiritual connection to their world, a temple of vast caves that wound their way to the planet&#39;s core, said to house the two Great Hearts of Ordo and Chao. Now, a long-forgotten connection to this place has left the Hollow a cesspool of undesirables, a cacophony of society&#39;s least wanted, poorest, and most unfortunate souls. They all attempt to eke out a laborious and meaningless existence toiling through what&#39;s known as The Heap for any glimmer of value to get their next meal.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Those who live here in the Hollow see firsthand how much damage the city above and its benefactors are doing to their world, to their society, but unfortunately, they are those who have the least power to make a difference.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Back to the Dark Ages:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The Hollow, a nearly medieval and lawless zone beneath the surface, is the front line of society&#39;s failure, where the worst crimes of the evil that has taken root are inflicted on the people.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Gangs and a medieval hierarchy of Lords control much of The Hollow, all under one Trash King, the mastermind who turned daily refuse into a stockpile of valuable items for the black market above.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Many of the Forgotten, lost and forgotten items from around the multiverse, find themselves here as the first place they gain consciousness when arriving from whatever dimension they are from, but very few ever leave.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Magical Refugees:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Many Mythicals have also found themselves here. After Magic became a controlled practice, many were forced into hiding if they refused to submit to complete loss of their privacy as their powers and abilities were put on public record.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">When many refused, a small civil war broke out, and when the City responded, even those who didn&#39;t take arms were forced from their lives, with many ending up in the Hollow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Although many have been known to escape to the surface into Mythagin, only a few Mythicals are ever granted access to the city, usually those who have given themselves up in servitude, using their powers for the benefit of the elite.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The Hollow now serves as a last bastion for the least fortunate, the last stop to rock bottom, a sign of things to come for all of Mythagin under the continued rule of the elite.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.ants5x3tensi"><span class="c7">Species</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The multiverse is infinitely full of life, below represents a fraction of that life.

These Elementals, known as the Primals, tended to the world, watching it grow, with powerful magics and a strong connection to the energy of this place.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Over the centuries, the Primals saw the evolution of the Naturals, tending to the great garden that first blanketed the heart-shaped world. Alongside, they nurtured all life forms and welcomed the world&#39;s first animals known as the Wildlings, born of Imaginatia with a curiosity to match.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The Primals were also there when the first Mythicals were born. A brave Wildling Lion had ventured deep into the heart of the forest and up to its highest peak. It is said the lion touched the rainbow rings, absorbing their magic and returning forever changed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">This brought about a new era of magical beings, capable of wielding the same elemental power as the Primals. The Primals welcomed them, fostering their talents and sharing their knowledge, with the cornerstone of civilization at its center.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The first tendrils grew up to the massive floating slab, and on its surface, the realm of Rainbowopolis was founded. This first settlement was a modest city made of magic and the elements that would one day serve as the foundation for the sparkling glitz and glamour of the high-rises of today.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.e04hf24liiyx"><span class="c7">The Naturals</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Plants and flowers that have gained sentience do not fall under the category of normal plants and flowers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The creation of the first earth elementals resulted in a side effect of the Elemental unicorn terra merging with the fungal network of the planet, bringing sentience to the flora and fauna of the early world.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Its Only Natural</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The first inhabitants to truly appreciate the life they were given were the Naturals, nurtured by the first Primals after the Elemental unicorns gave themselves to save the world. They covered the planet with their forests, wandering and thriving in this new world of wonder and magic. Beautiful flowers, blooms, the first vegetables and fruits all came to life, their sentience appreciative of the natural ecosystem from which they were born.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The Naturals worshiped the literal ground they walked on, seeing this planet as their mother and themselves as stewards of her longevity. Some even had minimal magical affinity, giving them the power to grow and heal the world and create more life. Through the new life they formed, the first evolution of animals came to be, mostly unaware, but some eventually evolved past their animalistic nature and became self-aware as the first Wildlings.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Modern-Day Naturalists</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Modern Naturals, much like their Primal predecessors, lost much of the magic flowing through them when the Crystal cracked, the Rainbow Rings faded, and darkness seeped into their world. Most Naturals have no magic at all, with little more than stories of their ancestors to remind them of their past.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Most Naturals stay out of the city, with many Roots making their homes in the Hollows below the city in small nomadic colonies, but most Naturals found their way back into the forest. Settlements and towns are scattered across the world, with their own government systems and trade routes. They live with very little consideration for those who live in the metropolis.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">But some still do live in the city and, just like everyone else, struggle to make ends meet. Gardeners, landscapers, florists - many are found in nature-adjacent fields and careers, but some take what they can get to get by.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.5ocalq7btkbu"><span class="c7">The Wildlings</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c4">There are animals, and then there are the Wildlings. The Wildlings are a step above your everyday cats, dogs, and general fauna of the world in all its fantastical forms, but none of them are magical, aside from the natural magic in evolution in all living things. These are the mundane animals that you&rsquo;d expect to see in nature, grazing, hunting, and thriving in the chaos without civilization.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The Wildlings, however, are walking, talking, living, working animals who have evolved past savagery and built themselves a place in society. Not mythical animals of lore and legend like the Mythicals, but everyday animals evolved into contributing citizens.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Naughty By Nature</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Still very closely related to their more primal ancestors, the Wildlings tend to take on their characteristics in their personalities, career paths, and in how they deal with what life throws at them. Some have even formed packs and gangs that have sprung up over time as a way for them to build community with their own.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Similarly, the same hierarchies as seen in the animal kingdom are still prevalent in the pecking order. Where prey and predator must coexist, there are still instinctual racial and social divides keeping them at odds.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Instinct vs Social Decency</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Although many Mythicals share a visual look of the animals their myths are based upon, one would be wise never to mix them up with a Wildling or suffer dire consequences, making the already muddy waters of the animal kingdom that much dirtier.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Society has had a hard time integrating the Wildlings, and that&rsquo;s a big part as to why many find home in the forests surrounding the city. Many Wildlings see pet ownership and confinement of animals as appalling but have always struggled to break the issue, and so the same stigmas seem to perpetuate through the decades.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Although life for the average Wildling isn&rsquo;t particularly harder than any other average citizen, the added complexities of the natural order in their lives are prevalent. An overlaying shadow ever present in their lives, giving it just an extra tinge of dissatisfaction those not a part of that hierarchy will never truly understand.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.6u0abnlggmpb"><span class="c7">The Mythicals</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The Primals were there when the first Mythicals were born. A brave lion had ventured deep into the heart of the forest and climbed to its highest peak. It is said he touched the rainbow rings, absorbing their magic, and returned forever changed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Lion Mane was the first true Mythical, and the powerful magic he had absorbed fell off of him, seeping into all the life he encountered. It would eventually claim his short life, but the new powers and magics he brought to the world.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Many thought it was the Rainbow Rings that gave him his power, but it was not. It was the chatter of the trees, the songs of the birds, and the voices of the animals who first wove his tale, his legend, that turned him into a myth and imbued him with power - the first hero, the first Myth.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Born of Myth and Legend</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Created of pure imagination, the Mythicals are considered closest to Imaginatia after the Elementals. Whenever a new Myth is born, they wander out from the forest and find their place in society.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The collective knowledge of the entire Mythical community is immeasurable - a hundredfold when compared to the collective consciousness of every other species. This is only due to Mythicals&#39; immortality.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Immortal Form</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Myths and legends live forever through song and stories from around the multiverse. These creatures persist - the canon of the universe, if you will. Here on the heart-shaped planet, these myths are personified and live on forever unless forgotten.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">But immortality is not what one would think here in the strangeness of the Imaginated universe. Though every immortal will physically live on forever, their matter and form are eternal, ageless and free of disease, and sometimes invulnerable.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">But the mind is a tricky thing, and even the most powerful and wisest immortals will eventually meet their psychological end. Their lifetimes aren&#39;t measured in physical life but in memory, in mind. Different lifespans for different Mythicals are common, but in the end, each has... an end.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Their minds turn over, fresh and new in their body, with the memories of the previous consciousness added to their collective subconscious, building upon it with each new iteration. But a wholly new being is born.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Although they retain - and in some cases can access - the memories, skills, and information of their past lives, most are just regular people going about their lives like anyone else, awaiting too the time when their consciousness ends to make way for something new.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Some relationships last through these transitions, and those who can recall past lives have even built systems of hereditary inheritance and have built wealth and status through them.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.h5p49i149tvi"><span class="c7">The Forgotten</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Not much is known of the other realms from which these strange items and discarded refuse come, but much of this world&#39;s technology and industrial expansion comes from their existence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Junk Personified</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Many of the items that fall through the rainbow orb from elsewhere are just junk of any kind. However, it would seem that some special pieces of junk have the potential for a life of their own, albeit not a very fortunate one.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Items with a significant personal relationship to their past owners, those items with sentimental value to their forbearers, change when traveling through the Rainbow Orb. The memory and personal connection infuse the item with consciousness and personality. That old favorite stuffed animal or favorite music-filled Macrosoft Prune MP3 player from an old flame, or the shovel used to bury a murdered spouse, all personal, all special to someone.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">These items have become known as The Forgotten. While most saw a slowly growing plight of new citizens, forcing overpopulation and stretching things thin, the Sugar Barons&#39; Master saw a labor force.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Squalor or Servitude</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">With control of the Rainbow Orb, the upper criminal echelon began to steal away The Forgotten when they fell through, throwing them into forced labor for the benefit of the elite in the city above. The underside swelled with an influx of The Forgotten, becoming a crowded cavern of old ruined city filled to the edges with the displaced refugees forced into this menial existence.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">For those lucky enough to slip through the city&#39;s fingers, dropped with the rest of the garbage into the scavenger-littered hollows below, they find themselves no better off than their city-side counterparts. Those tossed into the Hollows are met with a difficult life, either being drawn into the criminal underworld or just living a tough existence in the poorest part of this one great world.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Most of The Forgotten are looked upon with disdain by many of the native inhabitants to this dimension for their role in the city&#39;s downfall. The majority of The Forgotten feel the pressure of that disdain in their daily lives and have to adapt accordingly to survive.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.p7ovvivw5yr3"><span class="c7">The Technicals</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Although there was limited technology before the crystal was fractured, those devices relied entirely on the magic that supported them. Without it, much like a computer without electricity, they were nothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">True technology, as it is known now, came from somewhere entirely different and caused a massive shift in the world: the Rainbow Orb. When the crystal fractured, all manner of garbage and discarded technology flooded through, ushering in new and intriguing forms of devices. These devices relied on the physical properties of nature itself, harnessing electricity, electromagnetism, fusion, microwaves, and opening up the doors for a massive revolution.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">But how could a society entirely built on magic adapt to all this new information? In stepped a special breed of the Forgotten: the Technicals.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">On a Technicality</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">These &quot;discarded technology made sentient&quot; beings held the keys to the secrets of how they worked and how they could develop the infrastructure to sustain them. It was a matter of necessity for them, and many relied on charging to stay alive.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">In the early days, many of the devices died, and droves of their bodies ended up in the trash piles of the Hollow. While the ones that could survive found themselves enlisted into servitude in developing this new technology and outfitting their society with it for profits and power.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">After decades of development, the infrastructure to support them had revolutionized all of society, which didn&rsquo;t help the escalating fall of the city to where it stands now. Now sought after for their expertise by the city&#39;s elite and the criminal underworld alike, the Technicals have a strange sort of sway over the city.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Technical Revolution</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">One Technical had an inspiring notion one day, which sparked a new wave of revolution in the Hollows. They realized that all the discarded technology - those that relied on battery power before it existed, others that needed to be plugged in for life - could return. And so a pivotal &quot;Recharge&quot; began.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">With a huge influx of Technicals coming to life, a large settlement in the Hollows was formed: a community of Technicals called Grid 0-1 with a focus on sustainability through technology, harnessing the environment to stay charged, as a safe haven for all Technicals seeking refuge. This carved out for them a surprisingly well-maintained community separate from the riff-raff of the Hollows proper.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">With some of the world&#39;s biggest tech companies owned and operated by Technicals, their influence behind City walls is substantial as well. But the criminal mastermind behind the global elite was no fool and ensured only those Technicals capable of being corrupted made it to where they are as titans of industry.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.izewyowerykp"><span class="c7">The Edibles</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Contrary to their name, the Edibles are barely that. Many of the sentient foods fall under the Naturals category, such as fruits and vegetables, and other natural foods connected to the earth, full of the same magic and life you&#39;d want from healthy foods. They are the first to remind you that they are not Edibles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Hard to Process</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The Edibles are more of a classification for the foods and drinks made sentient from the Rainbow Orb. These are the garbage foods tossed away and deposited here from dimensions across the multiverse, such as fast food, processed meats, packaged goods, and anything made, not grown. This distinction is important and dictates how many of these foods are viewed by society. Mostly middle class and many working in the food service industry, they are generally left alone, with the exception of some distasteful treatment by organic foods.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">This is not the Garden of Eatin&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Being alive has its benefits, such as never going bad, but the downfall is that they can fall victim to rot, fungus, and other sources that cause decomposition if not treated. Therefore, there is a surprisingly large number of Edibles in the medical profession, mostly exclusive to the treatment of food-related ailments.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Otherwise, it&#39;s pretty hard to define them as a class, as their physical variety, personality differences, cultural beliefs, and societal viewpoints vary wildly, making them hard to target as a minority.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Edibles, however, do have to contend with some societal norms not in their favor. Eating-related crimes are hard to prosecute, and they generally leave little but crumbs as evidence. An entire criminal underworld has been built around food crimes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Being delicious comes at a cost.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.87zdfvvllzxc"><span class="c7">The Candies</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Although technically a form of edibles, the Candies pre-date the Rainbow Orb for one very distinct and obvious reason: the heart-shaped world being the first of the realms created by a young mind of the baby dragon Imaginatia, it is understandable that the creation of the candies took precedence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Kids Love Candy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The rivers that flow through the arteries of the planet, where the edges of the Hollow are built beneath the city above, consist of garbage-filled sugar streams flowing to the hearts at the core of the planet.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The young dragon, like most children, loved sweets and candy in their infancy and was imagining all sorts of treats, which of course spawned all manner of strange new candy-coated life.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">From the once clean rivers of sugar walked out the first Candies, who had begun building their society below the surface as the city above was just a small settlement. It would be decades before the two worlds met and the Candies would join the surface dwellers, as well as welcome them into their shrine below, the grand halls of the Hollows, revered for the life-giving sugar flows that raged past.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Bittersweet&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">But as the city above fell, as corruption seeped in and as the mastermind behind it all took hold, the Candies themselves were corrupted with the bile and evil spewed into the sugar flows below. They lost all sense of their sweetness, and many became willing participants in the city&#39;s demise, seizing control over the flow of sugar and playing the game for power and prestige.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Many Candies still live a life of sweetness, but few live behind the city walls. These Candies make up a decent portion of the citizens living on the outskirts of civilization with the rest of Mythagin.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">These Candies, although forsaking the more corrupt of their kind, are still faced with the minor stigma these bad actors brought on them. With a stranglehold on the flows of sugar, used as fuel and power for nearly everything in the world, these Sugar Barons as they became called are the worst of Candy kind.</span></p><h1 class="c8" id="h.kvc44uoiupfq"><span class="c9">Locations</span></h1><h2 class="c6" id="h.s6muuuhznjdc"><span class="c7">Rainbowopolis</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The Jewel of the Heart-Shaped Planet, Rainbowopolis, named after the rainbow rings that pass overhead, once stood as a pinnacle of free society, a near utopia that fed, housed, and cared for all its citizens.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The high-rises grew ever taller, breaking the atmosphere and becoming the galactic hub of commerce at their tips. It was a prosperous time for everyone, but even in this state of utopia, corruption made its nest.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Harder They Fall</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Now a den of crime and hedonism, the city has closed its walls to the outside world. Within its boundaries, a hoard of power and wealth leaves those not lucky enough to be born there to live in squalor.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The bridges extending from the floating isle on which the city is built to the mainland are all closely guarded, with entry and exit closely monitored and accounted for. Anyone caught within the city walls without permission is met with drastic and absurd punishments.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Like an Onion</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Rainbowopolis is built upon layer after layer of ruins of past cities. It is separated into two surface levels and two lower levels, which keeps the common class workers who maintain the city systems out of sight of the elite who galivant on the surface in their opulence and depravity.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The Underside is a labyrinth of city ruins supporting the industrial district above, where all the machinery and systems of the city are positioned for workers to maintain. Above where the light still reaches is the main surface, with highways and byways stretching up into the sky to connect the massive skyscrapers that cast their long shadows. At the peaks lies the Upper District, where commerce meets luxury, travel in the spaceports, and entertainment zones are dedicated to meeting every desire of the world&#39;s wealthiest.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Upper District</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Rainbowopolis reaches high into the atmosphere, built of layer upon layer of cities. The Upper District sits at the highest point as a gateway to the stars, where only the most luxurious and decadent live, and where the powers that be reside.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Spaceports dot the skyline at their peaks, offering commerce, nightlife, and all manner of hedonistic delights. The remains of the utopia have been bastardized, with its pure essence ripped up and given to the chosen few in exchange for their undying loyalty.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">At the topmost peak of the tallest towering totem lies the central headquarters of the sugar barons, Sucrose Industries, better known as the Sucrose Syndicate.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">In these upper levels of the city, the industry below is managed and meticulously micromanaged by the powers that be and their masterminds. The Upper District is a lattice work of interconnected skyscrapers, which provide the elite with their every whim while keeping their spoils of exploitation and industry safe.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">All off-world travel is done via the Upper District. A few coyotes can get people off-world for a price, but most are employed by the Upper District&#39;s residents in yet another opportunity for profit.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Lower District</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Far below the towering star port lines is the upper surface of the Lower District. It is a typical metropolis with all the amenities, including corporate headquarters, luxury lofts, and an intense shopping district. The city&#39;s main level boasts a high quality of life for those fortunate enough to live there, but unfortunately, entry seems to come with the prerequisite of being an utterly terrible monster.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The economic divide between those who live in the lap of luxury in the Lower District and the elite in the atmosphere is even larger than the gap between them and Mythagin, yet they still live like beyond royalty.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Here, everything is new and shiny, everything is about the next big thing. Consume is the name of the game, and demand is high. Addicted to commerce and the sugar that it is built on, Rainbowopolis Proper is the twisted, perverted version of the once true utopia that came before it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">All the amenities need a labor force, and the infrastructure to maintain it all. Below the Lower District is the Industrial District, and those who earn the privilege to work top-side. Most of the maintenance and services for the city are run below the surface, but top-side there is still a need for hired help.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">These workers are tightly monitored and vetted thoroughly. They clock in and out, their movements recorded, ensuring they return below where they belong.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Industrial District</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Below the bustling city lies the sub-sub basements, which mark the beginning of the Industrial District. The automation, services, and amenities of the city above are mostly run here. The manufacturing and industrial supply sectors that support everything above are also located here.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Workers from the Underside and Mythagin commute to the Industrial District for work, enduring long hours, little pay, and no chance of advancement unless the person above them dies on the production floor.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The Industrial District is unkempt and operates with sheer willpower. Due to lack of funding, many makeshift solutions are in place that could fail at any moment. The consequences of failure are severe: massive layoffs followed by new hires in a labor force hungry for any work they can get. Therefore, at the risk of their livelihoods, the workers maintain this delicate balance of patchwork systems to keep the elite happy and their jobs intact.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Underside</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Built on the shoulders of giants, the ruins of past developments now litter the underside, creating a dangerous and impossible maze of tunnels and streets condensed beneath the metropolis above.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">These tunnels lead right down to the bedrock, where the first settlements were founded. The underside has become a haven for those seeking a little freedom away from the watchful eyes of the Barons. Lawless, even the Barons won&#39;t dare to tread here. Without these essential workers, the city above would fail and operations would cease, plunging the city deep into ruin once again.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Much of this remote and uncharted place is uninhabited, but for those who know it inside and out, it can offer opportunity. Many of the Mythicals, first driven underground after they were forced to register, hid here. With the crystal fractured, many of the first Forgotten found their way here as a safe haven, creating a network of smugglers and founding the so-called rebellion.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Since the formation of the Rainbow Orb, the city has been in a cold war with the underside, who hold the city hostage with their power over the Industrial District. This stalemate has lasted for decades, with both sides finding uneasy comfort in the profit from this delicate balance.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.nh81bsswbod"><span class="c7">Mythagin</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The Mythagin district is located on the literal edge of the city and is home to most of its residents. While it is as close to a middle class as it gets, Mythagin has fallen on hard times since the city came under the control of the Barons, with its citizens and resources exploited and pushed to the brink.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Navigating Mythagin can be especially dangerous for the uninitiated, as lines are drawn and borders are etched between gangs, criminal organizations, and communities, each with their own regulations guiding their interactions. These borders are called &ldquo;The Kingdoms,&rdquo; and they make up the segregated sections of Mythagin Districts, with different influential families, organizations, and communities looking out for their own interests.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Having street smarts is critical to survive in Mythagin, and having a network of reliable contacts throughout each kingdom is a huge advantage. Each Kingdom demands respect for their traditions and culture, and having the know-how to navigate it all gives you access most will never have.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Mythagin itself is a stout part of the city, with its short, stubby buildings lining the crater&#39;s edge in a ring around the massive floating fortress of Rainbowopolis. Much of the city has been abandoned and left to decay, and squats are common while crime is rampant. But there is also a sense of community here, less based on support of one another and more a general sense of identifying with your fellow citizens, all having the grit and fortitude to survive this place.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Life in Mythagin is hard, arduous, and full of danger, with some part of the city seemingly in an unending state of riots and unrest. Most live life day by day, rolling with the punches and eking out a meager existence the best they can. The people here are hardened on the exterior and full of secrets, insecurities, and unfulfilled desires on the inside.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">It&#39;s hard not to live a complicated life here, even just getting by day to day is an adventure all its own. But some community can be found, some support for one another can shine through. Compassion is not lost, in a swaying balance against the chaos, and citizens who still find it in themselves to see through the hardened exteriors and bring out some goodwill in others, until the next back alley gunshot that is&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Central Mythagin</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The innermost ring of Mythagin lines the edge of the crater where the city hovers above the Hollow below. A highway rims the crater first, like a line in the sand around its circumference. Massive cables span the gap up into the sky, connecting to the floating city. Gated bridges rely on these cables to suspend them across the gap, connecting the mainland to the island above.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Across the highway from the crater&#39;s steep cliffs, the city begins. The highest buildings in Mythagin reside in this ring and taper ever lower as the city spans outward towards the Wildlands.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">This district houses all the higher-end living quarters, shopping and amenities, services, entertainment, and accommodations. Though much of this is limited, in disrepair, or right out abandoned. Sporadic slums are littered throughout, entire city blocks taken over by squatters, broken into The Kingdoms, building their communities with their own rules.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Commons</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The Commons, the next ring out from the crater after Central Mythagin, is closer to the Burbs and is a mixed living area, with houses and apartment buildings, warehouse districts, and city facilities such as sewage plants, power, and water.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Parts of the Commons also have planet side dockyards for interstellar shipping that employ many of the residents here. Much of the Commons is also home to the Rainbowopolis workforce, who commute daily in and out of the city to make their living.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Despite the inherent danger of living in Mythagin, the Commons is where you can find the most mediocre - and dare one say - stable existence here. However, like Central Mythagin, the Kingdoms extend across all of Mythagin, with their territories carved out. One has to choose wisely where they reside and obey the rules of their Kingdoms&#39; leadership.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Industrial Park</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The Industrial District is responsible for feeding the city with an endless supply of products and junk, thanks to the hardworking citizens across Mythagin. However, as the industry progresses, the area is constantly under development. Every few blocks, an old industrial park is torn down and rebuilt to accommodate new technology, which makes it difficult to navigate and even harder to live.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">During the work week, the traffic is high, but in the evenings and on weekends, the district is nearly empty. This constant flux favors the criminal elements of the city, who often use the abandoned facilities until they are renovated, as a base for their operations and shady dealings.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Although the air quality is terrible, it luckily seems to float out into the Wildlands away from the city, making life in the Dregs all the more uncomfortable. Little regard is given to nature, and the companies who control this district from their high-rise estates in the city treat this place as a commodity. They rip it up and rearrange it at their whim.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Dregs</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Few escape their lives in the Dregs. Even jumping to Central Mythagin comes with a substantial price tag or pledging oneself to one of the many Kingdoms that control it. Several housing projects, now but a memory, are home to tent cities and trailer parks filled with those unable to afford more.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Rarely policed, the Dregs is where the lawless zone truly begins. With a few ethical and moral standards upheld through social policing, still, anything goes if you can get away with it. Old malls and rec centers repurposed, subterranean subways turned into shelters, people doing whatever they can to survive.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Domestic violence, criminal activity, kidnappings, robberies, hit-and-runs, gang warfare, it&#39;s all just a part of the daily routine here. The air thick with smog from the Industrial District, most who live here have ailments and live short lives.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Bordering the Wildlands, the Dregs also see most of the outcasts who live in the Wilds, and many who do manage to leave end up wandering outward to the forest and not towards the city.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Off-grid shantytowns dominate the outer edge closest to the Wildlands, which the district borders. But still, some would say the Dregs are not the worst of it. Compared to life in The Hollow, the Dregs are a three-star hotel with a grime-filled pool.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.4hyh1zidm7io"><span class="c7">The Hollow</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Carved out from the world when life met death, the crater left behind is cast in shadow from the floating continent of the city above its cavernous depths. Like a spike, the hovering isle&#39;s base juts down into the deep. Below its base flows the sugar rivers of the heart-shaped world, and on the banks of these massive, syrupy waterways lies the worst of civilization.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Prior to the Crystal Fracture and the city&#39;s fall, the Hollow was hallowed, a revered place of worship, the closest point of civilization to the heart, and a shrine to the very life-giving sugar flows that they revered. But much of that culture was wiped clean when the corruption spread, and the Rainbow Orb began to rain down its waste into this once-sacred ground.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Built in the cathedral-like halls of the Hollow, what remains of society after everything has been stripped away barely survives. Feeding off the waste of the city above, this place is the most lawless and definitely the grungiest place on, or rather in, the planet.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Every day on cue comes the daily refuse rain, where the scavengers rush their skiffs across the sugary rapids to claim what salvage and debris they can collect before the rain ends. Dumping what has little value back into the waterways, they continue to poison the planet while living off these scraps from on high. A few enterprising criminals from the topside saw opportunity and built an empire on garbage from both the city and that which fell through the Rainbow Orb from across the multiverse.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">There are several districts in the Hollow, with the Docks being the main attraction. Built above sturdy walls is Fort Trash, where the garbage is sorted, valued, and shipped back to the surface for profits. And the Heap, the great garbage pile where most build their makeshift homes and shantytowns. Medieval in their vibe but built from scraps and garbage, this place is full of debauchery. Pirates, scavengers, brigands, and scallywags, you name it, and it&#39;s probably drunk here.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Lastly, deeper into the caverns of the planet is a place separate from the scum and villainy of the fort, and exclusive to the Technicals, called Grid 0-1. A sanctuary they built for themselves, using their own technology, they created it as a haven to recharge and build a sustainable existence with technology away from the rest of the world. A place not free of its own secrets and corruption.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Fort Trash</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Fort Trash was established after the Crystal Fracture and the Rainbow Orb showered the Hollow with garbage. As the debris began to wash ashore and build up, so did these new strange forms of life called the Forgotten. With nothing but the trash washed up on the shore with them, they began to build their civilization among the ruins of the old world.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Once intricately carved shrines in the bedrock, now filthy holes in the wall where squatters rest. The cathedral walls are now laced with barbed wire and sharpened metal, guarding the giant trash-laden heap beyond its gates, known as Fort Trash.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">It is a castle of trash, complete with all the accoutrements, including a moat and a drawbridge. Segregated from the Dockyard beyond its gates and the Heap that surrounds them in a wall of mounting garbage, Fort Trash is the headquarters of the Trash King. He rules the Hallow with a literal iron fist that he would hurl from his airship to crush all his enemies to dust.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">An entrepreneur and sadist, the Trash King saw his opportunity to enslave the newcomers and have them find him only the best trash from the multiverse to repair, refurbish, and resell to the city above. He sits as a self-proclaimed king of trash, owning and operating most of the skiffs that make the daily refuse rain runs. His labor force sorts and repairs the best pieces, discarding the rest into The Heap.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Behind the walls, there is a fairly decent stronghold with a wild and rowdy town of pirates, thieves, and brigands, and an economy to support their fiendish delights. It is not exactly a safe place, but with so much distraction, unless you&#39;re there looking to cause some trouble, there is too much going on to be noticed, just the way they like it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Heap</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Surrounding the town and rising up behind Fort Trash, and encompassing the entire fort and docks, is what has become known simply as The Heap. At its highest point, it towers like a mountain, affectionately nicknamed Mount Detritus, looming over Fort Trash like a dark shadow rising up the chasm&#39;s wall against the massive pillar of this ancient hole.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">All the junk pulled from the river, and anything that washes up on shore, is added to The Heap. What remains is usually worthless and is tossed onto the ever-growing mountain, which started as just a small pile but soon grew into a formidable mountain, wrapping around the entire settlement down to the river&#39;s edge.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The Heap has become a landmark of sorts, and some even summit its peak to challenge themselves. At the top of Mount Detritus, there is a docking station and base for The Trash King&#39;s airship, which he uses to get to and from the surface, keeping his subjects trapped below.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">As The Heap grows, so does the concern among the citizens who live in its increasing shadow. Some have set up small settlements outside The Heap&#39;s barrier and begun a new life free of The Trash King&#39;s reign, but not from piracy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">These settlements rely on scavenging The Heap for missed objects of value and traversing deeper into the heart of the planet to find items that wash up on the river&#39;s bank.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Docks</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The beating heart of the Hollow, the name &quot;The Dockyard&quot; doesn&rsquo;t quite capture the breadth and scope of this massive shoreline of commerce. Spanning for miles in both directions with settlements scattered along the way, the Dockyard houses most of the Hollow&rsquo;s population and workforce.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Skiffs and trawlers rely on the Dockyard to offload their daily hauls, keeping business booming. Much like behind the walls of Fort Trash, the streets and alleyways of the Dockyard are filled with life and debauchery. Scallywags and the less reputable find this a great place to blow off steam, make a few side hustles, and get into a fight or two.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Medieval in its design and construction, but built entirely of the trash that falls from the sky each day, this feudal-esque lifestyle isn&#39;t for the faint of heart. It&#39;s difficult to thrive unless you&#39;re a cutthroat, and when everyone is a cutthroat, who can survive?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Most of the more tempered citizens stay within the walls of the fort or find safety in numbers in their own small settlements along the beaten path. But if you&#39;re looking to do anything, The Dockyard is the place to go.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Grid 0</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">After the Technicals realized their influence, an enterprising young Technical sought to create a place just for them. Somewhere free from the tyranny of Rainbowopolis, where they could break away and recharge&mdash;literally.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Their streets are made of wireless charging technology, their community governed by AI, and their technological advancements sold to maintain their world. They are an oddity in the caverns below, not without their own elitism. They often turn away older technology and even oust Technicals who are becoming dated.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Whether in this sanctuary or living in the Hollows or above, Technicals have a status handed to them over other Forgotten. Even within the Forgotten community, there is friction. Not much is known about them other than they are advanced and reclusive. NO ONE other than Technicals are welcome, and even that doesn&rsquo;t guarantee entry. Their main export is new technology, adapting existing technology as a service.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Their charismatic leader built them this sanctuary and then disappeared into his compound built at its center. Speculation abounds about his reclusive nature, but not much else is known. Other than he keeps things running and updated.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The rest of the Technicals live here in relative peace, but their own brand of elitism keeps out outdated technologies and frowns upon becoming tech of the past. Some are even banished by their own kind, tossed out for growing old and inferior.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Some look at them as a cult, a subsect of the Technicals as a species. But without a view into their world, all there is on the outside is speculation and hearsay.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.861netf024u1"><span class="c7">The Wildlands</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Beyond the edge of Mythagin, across the dead plains, the forest line of the great Wildlands stands steadfast against the encroaching civilization. Still strong with magics and rampant with life, this great forest covers the globe apart from the lakes, rivers, and oceans, but has slowly crept back from the city as it fell to chaos.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Since the Crystal fracture and as the Hollow became more polluted and the planet poisoned, the forest crept its way back from the city&#39;s edge at a steady rate of a foot or so a year. Now, the great plains between the city and forest edge are known as the dead plains, where no life or plant can grow - a desert of dry mud and stone.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">As the forest&#39;s edge grows near, life in all its forms sprout and build a dense thicket like a barrier against the toxicity of the city beyond. As one steps through the brush and pushes into the forest, they are greeted with a breath of the freshest air, and a warm blanket of the magic that fills its roots would comfort them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">It is what attracts many to stay, wandering alone, or building their own tribes and communities truly free from the city&#39;s grasp. Many Naturals and Wildlings call the forest home, never interested in the life of the city. Mythicals also became a predominant species here after their civil war, and many fled to the tree line to the safety of nature.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">A source of pure magic, the forest is filled with dangerous and fantastical creatures, wild forms of life from the imagination of the young dragon&#39;s mind, and a bounty of life that evolved from it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">But the forest itself is alive, aware, its roots one nervous system of an entity the size of a planet. An entity that will defend itself. Those who live here must learn to take only what they need and to always give back to the forest or suffer its wrath.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The Sugar Barons and the city know this, and lost interest in the forest&#39;s bounty when it was proven too costly to tame and exploit. An uneasy truce has held strong, and the forest keeps its distance.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c4"></span></p></body></html>
